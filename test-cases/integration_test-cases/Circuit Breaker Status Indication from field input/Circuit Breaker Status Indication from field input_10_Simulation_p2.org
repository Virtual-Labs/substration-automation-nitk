* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Circuit Breaker Status Indication from field input experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/substration-automation-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Circuit Breaker Status Indication from field input/Circuit Breaker Status Indication from field input_01_Usability_smk.org][Circuit Breaker Status Indication from field input_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the Play button
  4. Click on the Pause button
  5. Click on the play button and click on the next button 
  6. click on the previous button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on the Play button the simulation Presentation should start playing and when we click on the Pause button the simulation Presentation should stop playing the Presentation 
  4. Again when we click on the Play button the simulation Presentation should start playing
  5. When we click on the next button the next Presentation should be played and When we click on the previous button the previous Presentation should be played
