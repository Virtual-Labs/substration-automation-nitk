* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Development of 11KV/433 volts substation automation scheme using PLC for timer ON/OFF load control experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/substration-automation-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Development of 11KV 433 volts substation automation scheme using PLC for timer ON OFF load control/Development of 11KV 433 volts substation automation scheme using PLC for timer ON OFF load control_01_Usability_smk.org][Development of 11KV 433 volts substation automation scheme using PLC for timer ON OFF load control_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Open the switches (circuit breaker) i.e. Incomer1, Incomer2, IncomerDG, Load1, Load2, Load3, Load4, Load5, Load6, and Load7 by clicking on the corresponding CB's 
  4. Now trip the circuirt by clicking on the trip switch

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. All the circuit breaker switches should be in ON position and trip switch should be in OFF state
  4. When we click on the trip switch, the load buttons should change to OFF state and CB switches should change to trip state
