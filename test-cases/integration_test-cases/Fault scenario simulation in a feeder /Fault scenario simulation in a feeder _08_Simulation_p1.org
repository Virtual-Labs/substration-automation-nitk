* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Fault scenario simulation in a feeder experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/substration-automation-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Fault scenario simulation in a feeder /Fault scenario simulation in a feeder _01_Usability_smk.org][Fault scenario simulation in a feeder _01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Close all the feeders in F1 and open all the feeders in F2
  4. Click on reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The values of I(A),V(kv),P(kw) in M1,M2,M3 should change and CB6 should get tripped
  4. All the feeders in F1&F2 should get open and the values of I(A),V(kv),P(kw) in M1,M2,M3 should be normal

* Review/comments
