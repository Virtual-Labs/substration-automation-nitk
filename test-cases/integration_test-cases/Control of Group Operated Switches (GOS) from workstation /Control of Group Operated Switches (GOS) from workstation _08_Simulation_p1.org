* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Control of Group Operated Switches (GOS) from workstation experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/substration-automation-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Control of Group Operated Switches (GOS) from workstation /Control of Group Operated Switches (GOS) from workstation _01_Usability_smk.org][Control of Group Operated Switches (GOS) from workstation _01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the OFF button of forced operation control for all the GOS

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. Once G.O.S is opened the color of display of G.O.S changes and also status in G.O.S status table is indicated as open and forced operation is indicated as close.

* Review/comments
