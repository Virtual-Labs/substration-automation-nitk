* Objective
  - To view the Simulation of the Control Of Bus Voltages Through Onload Tap Changes experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/substration-automation-nitk/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Control Of Bus Voltages Through Onload Tap Changes/Control Of Bus Voltages Through Onload Tap Changes_01_Usability_smk.org][Control Of Bus Voltages Through Onload Tap Changes_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Select the input voltage either low incomer or high incomer
  4. Decrease the tap value by clicking on the lower button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. One click on lower button,should change tap by 1.25% and should alter voltages correspondingly

* Review/comments
